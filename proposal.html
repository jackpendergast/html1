			<h2>Websites that inspired  my website.</h2>
			<a href="https://www.giovannafletcher.com/"><img src="images/giovannafletcher.png" width=300 height=300 alt="Giovanna Fletcher example image"></a>
			<p>I really enjoy this website. I like the pastel colors because they're really easy on the eyes. They also did a good job making the text readable.
			The navigation bar is very simple and minimalistic.

			<a href="https://www.blogger.com/about/"><img src="images/blogger.png" width=300 height=300 alt="Blogger example image"></a>
			<p>This website is also very minimalistic. They have very nice animations and the website feels almost interactive when you scroll.
			The page has a good flow to it, and the page doesn't scroll on forever.
